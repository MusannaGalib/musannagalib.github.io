    abstract = "{Casualty of garment factory workers from factory fire in Bangladesh is a recurring tragedy. Smoke, which is more fatal than fire itself, often propagates through different pathways from lower to upper floors during building fire. Among the toxic gases produced from a building fire, carbon monoxide (CO) can be deadly, even in small amounts. This paper models the propagation and transportation of fire induced smoke (CO) that resulted from the burning of synthetic polyester fibers using two open source platforms, CONTAM and Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). Smoke migration in a generic multistoried garment factory building in Bangladesh is modeled using CONTAM where each floor is compartmentalized by different zones. The elevator and stairway shafts are modeled by phantom zones to simulate contaminant (CO) transport from one floor to upper floors. FDS analysis involves burning of two different stacks of polyester jacket of six feet height and with a maximum heat release rate per unit area of 1500kw/m2 over a storage area 50m2 and 150m2, respectively. The resulting CO generation and removal rates from FDS are used in CONTAM to predict fire-borne CO propagation in different zones of the garment building. Findings of the study exhibit that the contaminant flow rate is a strong function of the position of building geometry, location of initiation of fire, amount of burnt material, presence of AHU and contaminant generation and removal rate of CO from the source location etc. The transport of fire-smoke in the building Hallways, stairways and lifts are also investigated in detail to examine the safe egress of the occupants in case of fire.}",

abstract={In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed to explore the variation of ion density and electric potential due to electrode surface modification. Two different surface morphologies, having planer and slit pore with different conditions of surface charge, have been studied for graphene-MnO2 surface using LAMMPS. For different pore widths, the concentration of ions in the double layer is observed to be very low when the surface of the graphene-MnO2 electrode is charged. With a view to identify the optimal pore size for the simulation domain considered, three different widths for the nano-slit type pores and the corresponding ion-ion interactions are examined. Though this effect is negligible for pores with 9.23 and 3.55 {\AA} widths, a considerable increase in the ionic concentration within the 7.10 {\AA} pores is observed when the electrode is kept neutral. The edge region of these nano-slit pores leads to effective energy storage by promoting ion separation and a significantly higher charge accumulation is found to occur on the edges compared to the basal planes. For the simulation domain of the present study, partition coefficient is maximum for a pore size of 7.10 {\AA}, indicating that the ions' penetration and movement into nano-slit pores are most favorable for this optimum pore size for MnO2-graphene electrodes with aqueous NaCl electrolyte.},

    abstract = "{Shell and tube heat exchangers (STHXs) have their pioneer use in industrial applications. The scope of this work is to design and optimize shell and tube heat exchanger of five distinct material combinations to comply with the requirements of effectiveness (heat recovery) and total cost as objective functions. For this purpose; thermal design is conducted according to TEMA specification in which tube outer diameter, length of tube, tube pitch, shell diameter, baffle spacing and baffle thickness are considered as primary design parameters. Ɛ-NTU method and Kern method are used to estimate tube side and shell side heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop respectively. For optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is implemented in Python to attain a set of multiple optimum solutions called ‘Pareto optimal solutions’ stating the maximum effectiveness and the minimum total cost. The range of design parameters of pareto optimal solutions are also reported. Furthermore, responsiveness of total cost with respect to effectiveness of pareto optimal fronts are addressed. The percentage change of effectiveness and total cost are analyzed for 20\\% increase of input design parameters. Finally, a case study is explored where the optimized design parameters are selected from the pareto optimal fronts depicting the optimal cost about \\$11400 with effectiveness 0.68. After the different fundamental dimensions are obtained from the thermal design, a detailed mechanical design is also achieved using TEMA specification.}",
