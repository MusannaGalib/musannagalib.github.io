Musanna Galibâ€™s research interests encompass exploring the core mechanisms that emerge in materials under different conditions using multiscale modeling and experiments. Currently, Musanna is working on solving the dendrite problem in rechargeable batteries at UBC. This work exists at the intersection of mechanics of materials, materials science, and electrochemical phenomena.  

Musanna Galib completed his M.Sc. (2019) and B.Sc. (2017) in Mechanical Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
